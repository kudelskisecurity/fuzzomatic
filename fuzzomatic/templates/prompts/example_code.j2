Given the following example usage of a Rust library,
give me a libfuzzer fuzz target in rust that targets the same code as in the example.
Do not include any println!, eprintln! or dbg! statements in the code.
Make sure to add any necessary include statements.
Make sure to use the `data` parameter and pass it to some of the library's functions.

Note that it's import to always produce fixed code that has the following structure:

```
#![no_main]

// any other extern crate declarations go here
extern crate libfuzzer_sys;

use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;
// any other imports go here



fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
    // fuzzed code goes here

});

```

Example usage:
