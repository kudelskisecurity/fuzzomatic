Given the following example unit test, of a Rust library,
give me a libfuzzer fuzz target in rust that targets the same code as in the unit test.
Do not include any definition of the  `{{ additional_function_name }}` function.
Do not include any println!, eprintln! or dbg! statements in the code.
Do not make any call to assert! or assert_eq!.
Make sure to add any necessary include statements.
Make sure to use the `data` parameter and pass it to some of the library's functions.

Note that it's import to always produce fixed code that has the following structure:

```
#![no_main]

// any other extern crate declarations go here
extern crate libfuzzer_sys;

use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;
{% for use_stmt in use_statements %}
    {{ use_stmt }}
{% endfor %}



fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
// fuzzed code goes here

});

```

Example unit test:

{{ test_function_code }}
