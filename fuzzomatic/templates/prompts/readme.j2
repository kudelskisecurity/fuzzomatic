Given the following README file and an example fuzz target,
give me an example of how to use the library's principal function,
in the goal of writing a libfuzzer fuzz target in rust.
Do not include any println!, eprintln! or dbg! statements in the code.
Make sure to add any necessary include statements.

Note that it's import to always produce fixed code that has the following example fuzz target structure:

```
#![no_main]

// any other extern crate declarations go here
extern crate libfuzzer_sys;

use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;
// any other imports go here



fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
    // fuzzed code goes here

});

```
